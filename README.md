# *rpoC* Database for Oral Microbiome Metataxonomics

Under construction!! We plan on building this repository to be a resource for rpoC amplicon analyses focusing on (for now) the oral microbiome. Current database version is the same as used for [Mann et al. 2023](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.00871-23)


Stay tuned for updates!

Authors: Allison E. Mann, Suzanne Crull
